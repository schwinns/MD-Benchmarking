GROMACS:      gmx mdrun, version 2020.5
Executable:   /jet/home/schwinns/pkgs/gromacs/2020.5/bin/gmx_mpi
Data prefix:  /jet/home/schwinns/pkgs/gromacs/2020.5
Working dir:  /ocean/projects/cts160011p/schwinns/benchmark/2022/AA-PA/CPU/test_Nnodes
Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -v -s ../npt.tpr -o npt -g N3_np384.log -ntomp 1

Compiled SIMD: SSE4.1, but for this host/run AVX2_256 might be better (see
log).
The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
gmx mdrun was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding gmx mdrun with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.
Reading file ../npt.tpr, VERSION 2020.5 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 40 to 100, rlist from 1.051 to 1.119


NOTE: Periodic molecules are present in this system. Because of this, the domain decomposition algorithm cannot easily determine the minimum cell size that it requires for treating bonded interactions. Instead, domain decomposition will assume that half the non-bonded cut-off will be a suitable lower bound.

Program:     gmx mdrun, version 2020.5
Source file: src/gromacs/domdec/domdec.cpp (line 2277)
MPI rank:    0 (out of 384)

Fatal error:
There is no domain decomposition for 288 ranks that is compatible with the
given box and a minimum cell size of 0.93375 nm
Change the number of ranks or mdrun option -rdd or -dds
Look in the log file for details on the domain decomposition

Primary job  terminated normally, but 1 process returned
a non-zero exit code. Per user-direction, the job has been aborted.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
mpirun detected that one or more processes exited with non-zero status, thus causing
the job to be terminated. The first process to do so was:

  Process name: [[11383,1],144]
  Exit code:    1
