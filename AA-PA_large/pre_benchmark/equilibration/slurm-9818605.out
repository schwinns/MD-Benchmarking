NOTE 1 [file topol.top, line 18]:
  System has non-zero total charge: -3885.474862
  Total charge should normally be an integer. See
  http://www.gromacs.org/Documentation/Floating_Point_Arithmetic
  for discussion on how close it should be to an integer.
  



WARNING 1 [file topol.top, line 18]:
  You are using Ewald electrostatics in a system with net charge. This can
  lead to severe artifacts, such as ions moving into regions with low
  dielectric, due to the uniform background charge. We suggest to
  neutralize your system with counter ions, possibly in combination with a
  physiological salt concentration.

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.000 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm
Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup

NOTE 2 [file nvt.mdp]:
  You are using geometric combination rules in LJ-PME, but your non-bonded
  C6 parameters do not follow these rules. This will introduce very small
  errors in the forces and energies in your simulations. Dispersion
  correction will correct total energy and/or pressure for isotropic
  systems, but not forces or surface tensions.

Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 192x192x192, spacing 0.115 0.115 0.115
Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.70

NOTE 3 [file nvt.mdp]:
  The optimal PME mesh load for parallel simulations is below 0.5
  and for highly parallel simulations between 0.25 and 0.33,
  for higher performance, increase the cut-off and the PME grid spacing.


This run will generate roughly 34 Mb of data

Compiled SIMD: SSE4.1, but for this host/run AVX2_256 might be better (see
log).
The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
gmx mdrun was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding gmx mdrun with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.

Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB got disabled because it was unsuitable to use.
 Average load imbalance: 33.1%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 23%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 7.7%.

NOTE: 7.7 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      You might want to use dynamic load balancing (option -dlb.)
      You can also consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.
