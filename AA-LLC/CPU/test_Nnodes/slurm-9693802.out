GROMACS:      gmx mdrun, version 2020.5
Executable:   /jet/home/schwinns/pkgs/gromacs/2020.5/bin/gmx_mpi
Data prefix:  /jet/home/schwinns/pkgs/gromacs/2020.5
Working dir:  /ocean/projects/cts160011p/schwinns/benchmark/2022/AA-LLC/CPU/test_Nnodes
Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -v -s ../npt.tpr -o npt -g N2_np640.log -ntomp 1

Compiled SIMD: SSE4.1, but for this host/run AVX2_256 might be better (see
log).
The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
gmx mdrun was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding gmx mdrun with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.
Reading file ../npt.tpr, VERSION 2020.5 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 40 to 100, rlist from 1.01 to 1.068


NOTE: Periodic molecules are present in this system. Because of this, the domain decomposition algorithm cannot easily determine the minimum cell size that it requires for treating bonded interactions. Instead, domain decomposition will assume that half the non-bonded cut-off will be a suitable lower bound.
Using 640 MPI processes

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

NOTE: PME load balancing increased the non-bonded workload by more than 50%.
      For better performance, use (more) PME ranks (mdrun -npme),
      or if you are beyond the scaling limit, use fewer total ranks (or nodes).


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was turned on during the run due to measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 19.9%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 61%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 12.1%.
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 % Y 0 % Z 0 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.975
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 0.4 %

NOTE: 12.1 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      You can consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.
